SQLite Kit
==========

This SQLite kit aims to ease working with SQLite databases in Cocoa by providing :

* An SQLiteObject, distantly related to NSManagedObject for CoreData
* SQLK structures, easing database generation and updating from XML files

The kit tries to complement **[fmdb][]**, the awesome SQLite Cocoa wrapper by Gus Mueller.
